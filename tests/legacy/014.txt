The Hare and the Tortoise=20
=20
A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise, =
who replied, laughing:  "Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat =
you in a race."  The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply =
impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox =
should choose the course and fix the goal.  On the day appointed for the =
race the two started together.  The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, =
but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the =
course.  The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep.  At last =
waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had =
reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue. =20
=20
Slow but steady wins the race. =20
